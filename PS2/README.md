# Setup 
- Note: Refer to `PS2.pdf` for complete instructions.
- Install <a href="https://conda.io/miniconda.html">Miniconda</a> (pyhon 3.6).
- Create a conda environment, using the appropriate command. On Windows, open the installed "Conda prompt" to run this command. On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command. Modify the command based on your OS ('linux', 'mac', or 'win'): `conda env create -f ps2_env_<OS>.yml`
- This should create an environment named `ps2`. Activate it using the following Windows command: `activate ps2` or the following MacOS / Linux command: `conda activate ps2`.
- Run `pip install - e .`
- Run the notebook using: `jupyter notebook ./ps2_code/ps2.ipynb`
